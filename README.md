A numerical cooling model that relies on parallel computation to model cooloing of 2D spaces. This set of codes is designed to model 2D cooling of magmatic bodies using the 2D temperature diffusion equation. There are two primary files containing the mdoel.

1. functions.py:
   Contains the functions that model cooling
2. rule_functions.py:
   Contains the empirical rules for sill emplacement.
